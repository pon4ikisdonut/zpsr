# ZPSR Programming Language 

**ZPSR** is a simple, Python-like programming language with a twist: it uses the Russian keyboard layout.  
This project was created by a developer from Ukraine as an experiment in alternative syntax and typing ergonomics.

## üí° What is ZPSR?

ZPSR stands for _"–•–æ—á–µ—à—å –ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å –Ω–∞ —ç—Ç–æ–º –∫–æ–¥? –õ—É—á—à–µ –Ω–µ –Ω–∞–¥–æ.."_ (Do you want to write code on this? Better not‚Ä¶).  
It is designed to resemble Python in structure and simplicity, but replaces standard Latin keywords and operators with their equivalents typed using a Russian keyboard layout.

This language was created as:

- A creative experiment in language design  
- A tool to explore how natural a programming language can feel on a non-English keyboard  
- A fun way to think differently about coding syntax

## üß† Features

- Python-inspired syntax
- Russian layout keywords and operators
- File extension: `.zpsr`
- Intended to run with a custom interpreter or transpiler (e.g., `zpsr <file>`)


```Example of code:

–∑–∫—à—Ç–µ("Write anything")
–µ—É—á–µ = —à—Ç–∑–≥–µ()

–∑–∫—à—Ç–µ(–µ—É—á–µ)
