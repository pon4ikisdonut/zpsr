# ZPSR Programming Language 

**ZPSR** is a simple, Python-like programming language with a twist: it uses the Russian keyboard layout.  
This project was created by a developer from Ukraine as an experiment in alternative syntax and typing ergonomics.

## 💡 What is ZPSR?

ZPSR stands for _"Знаешь Python - Попробуй Русский"_ (If you know Python — try Russian).  
It is designed to resemble Python in structure and simplicity, but replaces standard Latin keywords and operators with their equivalents typed using a Russian keyboard layout.

This language was created as:

- A creative experiment in language design  
- A tool to explore how natural a programming language can feel on a non-English keyboard  
- A fun way to think differently about coding syntax

## 🧠 Features

- Python-inspired syntax
- Russian layout keywords and operators
- File extension: `.zpsr`
- Intended to run with a custom interpreter or transpiler (e.g., `zpsr <file>`)


```Example of code:
